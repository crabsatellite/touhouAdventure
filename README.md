# Gremlins: A 2D Touhou Project Fan Game
## Description
Gremlins is a 2D game inspired and modified by a project from USYD's Java course, and the famous Touhou Project. The game is created using Java and built using Gradle. 

This game takes you on an adventurous journey where you play as a wizard, fighting your way through different stages filled with various enemies such as gremlins and super gremlins, along with their slimes. Each stage presents a unique map that poses new challenges and opportunities. One of the highlights of this game is its support for adding custom maps, which allows you to customize and create your unique gameplay experiences.

## Features
* Multiple Stages: The game comes with various stages, each with a different layout and set of enemies. Upon clearing all enemies in a stage, the wizard advances to the next stage.

* Enemies: The game features gremlins and super gremlins as the adversaries. They can move around and spawn slimes to add to the player's challenge.

* Fireballs: The wizard can fire fireballs to destroy enemies and their slimes. The fireballs disappear after traveling a certain distance or upon hitting enemies.

* Power-ups: Power-ups randomly spawn on the map. When the wizard picks up a power-up, it temporarily increases the wizard's capabilities.

* Custom Maps: The game provides a mechanism to create and add your own custom maps to the gameplay. This greatly enhances the replayability and longevity of the game.

* Game Status: The game keeps track of the wizard's remaining lives, current stage, power-up status, and attack cooldown. If the wizard loses all lives or completes all stages, the game will display a game-over or victory message accordingly.

* Controls: The game features intuitive keyboard controls to move the wizard and fire fireballs.
